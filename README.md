# Plant Disease Detector 

A deep learning system that classifies plant diseases from leaf images using Convolutional Neural Networks.

# Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

# Problem Statement
Farmers often face loss due to late or incorrect identification of plant diseases.  
This model helps identify common diseases early by analyzing images of leaves.

# Features
- Image preprocessing pipeline (resizing, denoising)
- CNN model for multi-class classification
- Achieved 92% accuracy on test dataset

# Dataset
- Used a Kaggle dataset of 30,000+ labeled leaf images
- Includes classes for bacterial spot, early blight, leaf mold, etc.

# Future Enhancements
- Deploy as a mobile app
- Real-time image capture and classification
